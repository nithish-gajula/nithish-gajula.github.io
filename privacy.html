      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all software, including Android apps, iOS
        apps, desktop tools, or other software that I develop and provide
        (referred to as “the Software”).

      <b>Data Collection and Use</b>
      <p>
        I do not intentionally collect any personal data from users. However,
        some of the Software may use third-party services that may collect
        information automatically, such as device information, usage data, crash
        reports, or advertising data. This information is used to help improve
        the quality and performance of the Software.
      </p>

      <br>
      <b>Third-Party Services</b>
      <p>Some of the Software may use one or more of the following services:</p>

        Other third-party libraries or services may also be used. These will be
        listed in the “About” or “Information” section of each Software (if
